## Packaging, publishing:

If you want to test an extension on your local install of VSCode

We need to install vsce package manager:

```bash
npm install -g vsce
```

## Generate .vsix file:
This file format is used to share the plugin privately with others.
Run vsce package in extension root folder to create such VSIX files.
```bash
$ cd path/to/vscode-plugin
$ vsce package
# aifix4seccode-vscode-x.y.z.vsix generated
```

### (x): major version
